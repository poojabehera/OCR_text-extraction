These include experts in air emissions, water use and quality, remediation, wildlife and habitat, oil and hazardous substances, archaeology and cultural resources, and environmental policy, all critical to the responsible development and ongoing operation and compliance of our facilities. Whether it is a modernization of an existing generation facility, a clean energy development project, a transmission or distribution infrastructure project or development of corporate facilities, our environmental services team is part of the entire life cycle of the project to ensure that we identify, mitigate and manage any potential impacts to We also work closely with a wide range of environmental organizations to ensure responsible development and operations and to complete environmental stewardship projects that go beyond compliance. We also invest philanthropic dollars for environmental education, conservation and research. We employ a multifaceted, proactive approach to managing environmental protection and stewardship and achieving our goal of zero significant environmental events every year. Our programs include employee and contractor training, daily site inspections, remote satellite and drone monitoring, routine self-assessments, compliance tracking systems, environmental construction monitoring, environmental audits, quarterly business unit reviews with our Corporate Environmental Governance Council and quarterly due diligence reporting to executive management and the NextEra Energy Climate change, decarbonization and Real Zero carbon emissions reductions We believe our industry can best confront climate change by investing in clean power generation that produces zero or low emissions. This has been part of the strategy across all of our businesses for a long period of time and is a key element of our Real Zero goal. Our portfolio has one of the lowest emissions profiles of any utility in North America. In 2021, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and CO2 rates were 98%, 74% and 51% lower, respectively, than the U.S. electric power sector average.

To ensure sustainable access to water, we are active stewards of sourcing, using and managing this critical resource in the communities in which we operate. We embed water conservation management strategies into our business planning and operational practices to lower costs and mitigate risks posed by water availability. We reduce consumption through efficiency, technology and operational improvements. Our investments in water-free wind and PV solar energy, which currently comprise more than a third of our company’s generating capacity, avoided the use of more than 20 billion gallons of water in 2021.

       "  'paragraph': 'Importantly, 98% of water withdrawn for use at our natural gas plants is withdrawn via a once- through cooling system and then returned to its original source. The remainder is reused or consumed through evaporation or deep-well injection. Only one of 25 of our generation facilities that use water is located in a region of high or extremely high water stress in the U.S. In 2021, we used 7.1 billion gallons of reclaimed water for cooling purposes. Doing so offsets the demand for higher-quality water and reduces water supply risk. We continue to find innovative ways at our generation facilities to use the lowest- quality water sources, including reclaimed water, which reduce impacts to higher-quality sources like groundwater. At FPL’s Sanford Plant, we are transitioning from using groundwater to surface water, which assists the St. Johns River Water Management District in protecting the Volusia Blue Spring. Additionally, at FPL’s Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, we are deepening a groundwater well to use lesser quality water from the Avion Park Production Zone, instead of sourcing water from the Upper Floridan Aquifer. In June 2020, the Miami-Dade County Commission approved FPL’s proposed development of an advanced reclaimed water project to reuse treated wastewater from the county at FPL’s Turkey Point Clean Energy Center. The state-of-the-art FPL Miami-Dade Clean Water Recovery Center (CWRC) will further treat and reuse up to 15 million gallons of reclaimed water per day from the South District Wastewater Treatment Plant in Miami-Dade County. FPL will use 100% of that reclaimed water to cool a natural gas plant at Turkey Point. A win-win for FPL customers, Miami-Dade County and the Sunshine State, the CWRC will increase resiliency at the Turkey Point Clean Energy Center, provide a cost-effective way to reuse and recycle treated wastewater that would otherwise be discarded, and conserve Floridan Aquifer groundwater at the Turkey Point site. The CWRC also will help Miami-Dade County meet regulations of the Ocean Outfall Act, which set a state requirement for Miami- Dade County to reuse 60% of its wastewater. We believe the best way to deliver environmental value by minimizing our waste footprint begins with reducing the amount of waste we generate in the first place. Then, we look for opportunities to reuse and recycle materials to minimize the waste that we send to From modernizing many of our facilities and reducing the amount of oil-ash generated to banning the use of chlorinated solvents at all facilities and continuing to phase out polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) equipment, we are reducing the amount of waste generated.'},\n",

We have greatly reduced the amount of hazardous waste we generate to maintain the status of a Very Small Quantity Generator, the lowest possible federal regulatory classification. NextEra Energy provides documented training to employees to ensure that hazardous waste, when generated, is properly identified, stored, disposed or recycled. All aspects of waste management are validated through facility environmental audits that include records review, site inspection and personnel interviews. In addition, all waste management vendors receive an environmental audit from either internal audit personnel or through CHWMEG, a nonprofit trade association, and its global Facility Review Program. Active engagement with industry groups, like Cross-Cutting Issues Group and the Electric Power Research Institute, also helps ensure understanding of evolving standards and compliance obligations. We also seek opportunities to identify and implement reuse and recycling programs that result in environmental and economic benefits. In 2021, our corporate recycling and services facility reconditioned and redirected $4.7 million worth of equipment back into inventory. In addition, our investment recovery team engages a seven-step process for asset disposition when assets reach the end-of-use stage: reuse, recondition, return, resell, reclaim, recycle and remove.

       "  'paragraph': 'Another example of how NextEra Energy is working to reduce waste and streamline costs comes from our supply chain business unit. FPL replaces poles as needed due to aging, storms and grid hardening efforts. These poles include both wood and reinforced concrete. Historically, wood poles were cut into manageable pieces and collected for landfill disposal. Concrete poles would be transported to a crusher, with FPL covering transit costs. The team identified a source to recycle wood and concrete poles and reduce landfill costs, saving $400,000 in cost avoidance and keeping 20.5 million pounds of debris out of the landfill. Our partner provides one-stop support for all poles. About 75% of the wood poles are now redeployed to landscapers or other end re-users so only 25% go to landfill, while all concrete poles are crushed and used as aggregate. While our solar and wind fleet are still early in their operating lives, we are working with our vendors on recycling plans. We have proactively worked with solar vendors on plans to first reuse solar infrastructure components when a site is decommissioned and, in the event they cannot be reused, to recycle them. We have recently employed the same collaboration with wind vendors for waste management as we decommission or repower wind sites. Many of our wind vendors have made significant strides in recycling. This was recently demonstrated by GE Renewable Energy’s announcement that it has entered into long-term contracts to recycle blades removed from its U.S.-based turbines during upgrades or repowering. The recycled blades are used as a raw material for cement. In 2021, 580 blades from five projects were identified for recycling, including 393 that were removed in 2020 and recycled in 2021 and an additional 287 blades that were removed in 2021 to be recycled in 2022. Preserving and protecting habitat and wildlife Environmental stewardship includes habitat and wildlife protection. Before we build any operating facility, we study the local ecosystem so that we can better understand what it takes to be a partner in its preservation and to be a good neighbor to all the species that live there.

The reptiles have found an ideal home in the habitat surrounding FPL’s Turkey Point Clean Energy Center in Florida. Researchers determined the cause of the manatee UME is starvation attributed to a lack of seagrass, a primary food source, in the Indian River Lagoon. Supporting research to restore and recover seagrass can positively benefit the health of Florida manatees. With this knowledge, the NextEra Energy Foundation provided grants to the Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Foundation for the FAU Harbor Branch Experimental Seagrass Nursery and to the Florida Oceanographic Society to support seagrass research and on-site seagrass nursery operations. Additionally, in partnership with the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida, FPL funded a new manatee rescue transport truck for FWC. This truck was added to the FWC fleet to expand rescue efforts and transport sick or injured manatees to rehabilitation facilities On the brink of extirpation from the U.S. in the late 1970s due to habitat loss, the American crocodile has made a dramatic comeback in the habitat surrounding FPL’s Turkey Point Clean Energy Center.

       "  'paragraph': 'This plant has a 5,900-acre, manmade cooling canal system and surrounding land that offers ideal nesting conditions for the American crocodile. Our crocodile management program includes protecting these nesting areas, completing population surveys, conducting capture and spatial distribution surveys, and regulating plant activity at night and during nesting season. In 2021, FPL biologists captured, tagged and released a record setting 565 hatchlings. Our strategy to prepare historical nesting locations before the season and improve the water quality of the cooling canal system led to 27 successful nests in 2021, the second-highest year on record, behind 28 successful nests in 2008. Avian protection programs We have taken the initiative to protect bird species through several innovative programs. When siting projects, we are dedicated to avoiding and minimizing impacts to both terrestrial and avian species and their habitat. For NextEra Energy Resources’ wind facilities, we follow industry and agency guidelines, which include voluntarily collecting and providing eagle nesting and avian point count survey data results, as well as post-construction mortality monitoring results, to the USFWS. Our practice also is to site our turbines at least 2 miles away from every known eagle nest, unless otherwise approved by USFWS. In addition to our siting practices, we use IdentiFlight®, a developing automated technology used to detect, identify and protect eagles at wind farms by using high performance optical systems paired with machine vision software. Golden Hills Wind, LLC has been conducting a pilot project using this technology to minimize effects to golden eagles at the site. By detecting an eagle as far as 1 kilometer out from an operating wind turbine, in real time, the IdentiFlight system maximizes the protection for eagles compared to other non-automated systems. The pilot project, at the two-year mark, is demonstrating very promising results. In addition to our project specific work, we have funded several research projects related to eagle population assessments and eagle conservation. NextEra Energy Resources also has recently reached a voluntary agreement with the federal government pursuant to which it will spend up to approximately $27 million to minimize additional eagle deaths and injuries at approximately 50 of its existing wind facilities. NextEra Energy Resources continues to minimize our interactions with bald and golden eagles through our siting practices, research and conservation. See our statement for additional details. Since 2007, FPL has invested more than $130 million to construct and retrofit more than 150,000 poles to make them more bird-friendly, reducing avian risk and improving service reliability to our customers. To identify and proactively address high-risk distribution structures, FPL created the energy industry’s first avian risk assessment model. In 2014, FPL updated the avian risk assessment model to further enhance avian assessment for eagles and wood storks and protection processes.'},\n",

FPL has sponsored the South Florida FIRST Robotics competition and supported more than 500 teams over the past decade. Each year a $20,000 college scholarship is awarded to an outstanding alumnus of the FIRST robotics program. Through the NextEra Energy Foundation, NextEra Energy Resources and FPL recently awarded their inaugural Classroom Makeover Grants. Each year through 2024, 10 schools – 40 in all – will be selected to receive a $50,000 grant. The grants are intended to provide transformational learning experiences for Black students in classroom settings. All recipient schools are comprised of 25% or more Black students, bringing potential together with opportunity so all children can succeed. The Classroom Makeover Grant program directly addresses needs in infrastructure, technology and resources like software, equipment and books. Educators everywhere faced challenges at the highest levels due to COVID-19. Among the many lessons learned, leveraging technology and looking for innovative ways to reach and teach students at all ages topped the list. FPL’s energy curriculum portal provides a robust virtual curriculum for fourth, fifth and sixth grades that covers energy standards in science, English language arts and math. The free, open-source online curriculum is designed to ensure that students have a deeper understanding about the importance of energy and all of its forms and is available at energycurriculum.com. As early as 22 years ago, FPL incorporated experiential learning and has offered a traveling science show at no charge to elementary schools offering important energy conservation lessons. Since 2000, the show has reached more than 1 million students and more than 80% of those students attend Title 1 schools. NextEra Energy offers scholarships for Black students in the Southeastern Consortium of Minorities in Engineering (SECME) and has committed $1.8 million over the next four years to make sure our future workforce is representative of the communities we serve.'},\n",

Multiple opportunities for project participation are available to tribes throughout a project’s development, including site visits, cultural surveys, construction monitoring and special studies. Staff coordination is conducted with respect and sensitivity to each tribe’s cultural concerns or needs. Tribal community support is provided by working with tribes to identify national, regional and local tribal community needs. For example, in 2021, NextEra Energy created a scholarship program for Native American youth, administered by the American Indian Graduate Center. Fifteen scholarships are awarded annually to qualified students in energy, environmental and cultural resource disciplines. Internal education for our development, environmental and construction teams is vital to our efforts to build strong collaborative relationships with tribes. By learning about Native American and Indigenous practices, traditions, cultural awareness and sensitivities, our tribal/ Indigenous relations staff provide training for developers, subject matter experts/support staff and construction personnel.

       "  'paragraph': 'Investments at our regulated utilities are guided through a well-established integrated resource planning process to determine the amount and timing of future generation needed to meet projected growth in energy load and demand. Our carbon footprint and potential climate-related risks are incorporated into this planning process. Different options are evaluated taking into account system economics, forecasted electric power demand, demand-side management, fuel prices, potential future climate policies, and the integration of low-cost, clean and reliable generation, including solar and battery energy storage solutions. Our capital allocation process at FPL is centered on enhancing the overall customer value proposition to deliver long-term customer benefits and the support of regulators for our investment decisions. Review of NextEra Energy Resources’ investment decisions begins with thorough due diligence by subject matter experts from nearly 20 key functional areas. These subject matter experts, who bring deep experience and expertise, help identify and assess the commercial, financial and operational feasibility of new project investment opportunities. We also have processes in place to ensure we are continuously learning from unforeseen challenges to improve future capital allocation decisions. FPL and NextEra Energy Resources hold annual strategy sessions with business unit leadership across each organization to identify and review long-term goals, risks and opportunities. The results of these annual strategy sessions are reviewed with the board of directors to ensure key risks are identified and managed, and opportunities to enhance customer and shareholder value creation are pursued. For the purposes of our risk management process, we do not view climate change as a discrete risk, but rather a potential stress multiplier to existing risks and opportunities already under consideration. For example, system disruption from a weather event is a long-standing risk that we have integrated into our risk-assessment process, and potential climate change projections for more frequent storms would be a multiplier for this risk category but not necessarily broken out as an incremental, separate impact. We also recognize that climate change may affect different parts of our business in different ways. We provide more details on our approach to managing environmental risks and our strategy under Environment in this report. Preparing for storms, flooding and sea-level rise Physical risks are reviewed as part of our corporate risk management process, including the risks of more frequent and severe storms, flooding and sea-level rise as a result of climate change. Our experience and history of managing hurricanes and natural disasters in Florida provides us with the skills and capabilities to remain focused on safety, execution and the importance of providing an essential service to our customers during these events.'},\n",

Our Florida nuclear facilities are elevated 20 feet above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surge. We expect to continue to make additional resiliency and reliability investments over the coming decades to mitigate any potential impacts to our system. Mitigation actions taken to date include: A good example of how our storm hardening investments have created value for our customers is to compare the last two major hurricanes that hit FPL’s service area: Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and Hurricane Irma in 2017. Although Irma was a more powerful storm, with nearly 50% greater damage potential than Wilma, FPL was able to reduce the average number of outage days per customer by 60%. Hurricane Irma was the largest hurricane event FPL has ever faced with more than 4.4 million, or nearly 90% of customers, losing power compared to roughly 3.2 million, or 75% of customers, due to Hurricane Wilma. As a result of our storm hardening investments, FPL improved restoration times, sustained less equipment damage, lost fewer poles and brought our generation facilities back faster than ever.
